First Steps ...

1) Create your first note

Navigate to a webpage that interests you (like maybe this recipe for bran muffins) and then click on the SpiderNotes icon in your web-browser's toolbar to open the SpiderNotes window.

The "Web-addresses and/or tags" field defaults to the web-address of your active tab, but you can enter anything you like: tags or multiple web-addresses, or both.

Compose your note and then click "Add".

2) Enable encryption

Click on the "Options" link at the top of the SpiderNotes window to open the options page.

In the "Encryption" section, enter a password and then click "Encrypt".

Yay, your notes are now encrypted!

3) Synchronize with other devices

In the "Synchronization" section, click on "Enable Synchronization". If you're signed in to Chrome, then you're all set: your notes are automatically synced with devices in which you've signed in to Chrome.

You can also sync your notes with other devices by connecting to your Social Login account on Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter or Yahoo!
